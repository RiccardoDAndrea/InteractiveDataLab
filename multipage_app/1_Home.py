""" 
The following script was created to give users the opportunity to learn how to handle a simple machine learning concept.

1. the user starts on the home page
--> Afterwards the User has the possibility to choose between the section 

2. Machine learning
Here the user has the possibility to choose between two predefined datasets or to use his own dataset. As well as to choose the column separator freely.
Then follows the Machine Learning process which is structured as follows.

    - Overview',
        -> df.head(), df.describe(), df.isna().sum() quick overview for the data

    - 'Change the data type',
        -> The user can change the data type if the data is not imported as he/she imagined it.

    - 'Handling missing values',
        -> Each Dataset can have NaN values so we can SOLVE this problem. Here the user can replace the NaN with different possibilities. 
           Depending on the dataset, he can make the best choice of how he wants to replace the NaN values.

    - 'Remove columns',
        -> For better clarity, it is possible to remove entire columns. 

    - 'Visualisation',
        -> In the visualisation area, many different charts can be developed from 
            1. Barchart
            2. Linechart
            3. Scatterchart
            4. Boxplot
            5. Histogram

    - Machine Learning
        ->  In the final area of machine learning, a correlation matrix is created that the user can look at in terms of multicollinearity. But also to determine / evaluate the correlation between the variables. 
            After that, a "target variable" and the "X variables" can be freely selected.
            After successful entry of the X and Y variables, the size of the train and test data set can be determined with a link.
            The most important metrics of a regression model are briefly described below. From Intercept, Slope, RMSE, MAE.

            Two dynamised scatter charts follow 
            1. scatterchart are the Acutal versus the Predicted values
            2. scatterchart are the residuals

            In the last section, after importing the data, Data manipulation, Data visualization. 
            The user can test his regression through freely selectable input options and the result as Output.

3. Objection detection (under construction)

4. Contact

To all of you who have taken the time to visit my site and are now reading the script. Thank you so much for taking the time - I really appreciate it. 

If YOU see any improvements, potential errors or optimisation potential please don't hesitate to let me know.
-- Thank you in advance

    the allergy sufferers among the guests. Whether it's cars, buildings or faces - thanks to 
    object recognition, we can identify and track everything. But be careful! If you send the

    separate object - and that probably wouldn't get it very far!""")
