# 🤖 Interactive Machine Learning Website
Welcome to our my Streamlit webpage. My name is Riccardo and I am a data enthusiast frome Data engineer till a Data Scientist. 
My Page is build up with Streamlit. The great thing about Streamlit is that I can build a creat everthing like my imagination as long i can code it properly.
My webpage is seperates in multiple parts. 
The first part is the 

#### *1. Welcome Page*
Were i introduce my self very shortly, And also some explanation of the projects that i have implemented.

#### *2. Machine Learning (Linear Regression)*
In the machine Learning Section it was for me important to explain what is machine Learning and what are some important compontons to it.
Also i helps we the visted the code and implemented new features when i have learned to things. 
The user can upload what ever data file he wants. 
The range on componted is very wide from a
