Welcome to my Streamlit webpage! My name is 
**Riccardo** , and I am a data enthusiast, ranging from Data Engineer to Data Scientist.

My page is built using Streamlit. The great thing about Streamlit is that I can build and create anything my imagination desires, as long as I can code it properly.

My webpage is separated into multiple parts.

## 1. Welcome Page

Here, I introduce myself briefly and provide explanations of the projects I have implemented.

## 2. Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

In the Machine Learning section, it's important for me to explain what machine learning is and discuss some important components. It also helps me to remember and solidify my knowledge when I code and write down explanations.

The range of components is wide, including:
- Overview
- Changing data types
- Handling missing values
- Removing columns
- Visualization
- Machine Learning

You can start with data exploration and then perform various preprocessing steps. Once you have prepared your data, you can initiate model training and evaluate the performance of the model. üîçüß™üî¢

Please feel free to explore the different features and functionalities of our website, and don't hesitate to provide any feedback or suggestions. I hope you find this platform helpful in your machine learning journey! üåü

## 3. Stock Dashboard

When questioning the proliferation of stock dashboards, it's evident that there are numerous options available. The fundamental purpose of a stock dashboard lies in its utilization of an API, serving as a tool for training and learning. As a burgeoning data scientist, the typical practice involves sourcing data from external providers, often of impeccable quality and reliability. However, my curiosity extends beyond merely accessing pre-existing data; I seek to comprehend the origins of this journey. It's about understanding the foundational steps: where does the data originate, and how can it be effectively stored and managed? This quest marks the inception of my exploration into data acquisition and storage processes.

With that said, the main components are that the user can choose their stock ticker, which they can freely enter. The user can also insert multiple stock tickers. After that, you have a variety of metrics that you can choose from, but also some visualizations. The Metrics as followed:
- Business Summary, 
- Stock Performance,
- Trailing PE, 
- Dividends, 
- PE Ratio,
- P/B ratio, 
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio, 
- Free Cash Flow, 
- EBITDA, 
- Revenue, 
- Short Ratio

These are what you can inspect on the Streamlit page.
After that you also have a section for the news related to your Stock. 

## 4. Contact
Lastly, there's a section dedicated to getting to know me better. Here, I delve into details about myself, how to reach out to me, and the programming languages and packages I am proficient in. Additionally, you'll find my 
#### CV available in both English and German languages.


**At the moment, there are some errors on the page. I am working on it and will update all errors as soon as possible.** üòä‚ú®
