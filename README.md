# 🤖 Interactive Machine Learning Website
Welcome to my Streamlit webpage. My name is Riccardo and I am a data enthusiast frome Data engineer till a Data Scientist. 
My Page is build up with Streamlit. The great thing about Streamlit is that I can build and creat everthing like my imagination as long i can code it properly.
My webpage is seperates in multiple parts. 
The first part is the 

#### *1. Welcome Page*
Were i introduce my self very shortly, and also some explanation of the projects that i have implemented.

#### *2. Machine Learning (Linear Regression)*
In the machine Learning Section it was for me important to explain what is machine Learning and what are some important compontons to it.
Also it helps me to remember and manifest my konwloadge when I code it and write down some explanation to it.

The range on componted is very wide from a 
#### [Overview, Change a data type, Handling missing values, Remove columns, Viszualisation, Machine Learning]
You can start with data exploration and then perform various preprocessing steps. Once you have prepared your data, you can initiate model training and evaluate the performance of the model. 🔍🧪🔢
Please feel free to explore the different features and functionalities of our website and don't hesitate to provide any feedback or suggestions. I hope you find this platform helpful in your machine learning journey! 🌟

#### *3. Stock Dashboard*
When you ask your self why a Stock Dasboard there a plenty of them. True there are plenty of them. The hole purpose of the Stockdasboard is to work with an API and to train with the API. So that can retrive data. As a young and learning Data Scientist you always get your Data. But i wanted to understand where the hole journed start. To answer the question where does my data come frome and how can is store it. How does everything starts ?
